        <p class="hero-lead">
          We are a Dublin-based real estate team focused on helping people find
          high-quality and affordable homes across Ireland.
        </p>

        <p class="hero-body">
          This app was created as part of a college assignment to demonstrate
          property listings, detail views, and booking features using modern
          web technologies like Ionic and Firebase.
        </p>

        <p class="hero-body">
          Our goal is to make the process of renting or buying as simple as
          possible – from discovering properties to viewing details to booking
          a viewing. Everything is powered by Firebase and Ionic.
